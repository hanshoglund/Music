Title and note
----------

Passager (sv. passages, paths)

Instrumentation
----------

  * Violin I-IV
  * Viola I-II
  * Cello I-II
  * Double Bass

Timing
----------

This piece makes use of both metrical and non-metrical passages.

* Metrical passages are played as usual and may be conducted.
* Non-metrical passages are approximate in duration and may be cued by
  the conductor. A slight drift from the tempi indicated in the score is
  perfectly acceptable. 


Tuning
----------

  * Odd-numbered Vl, Vla and Vc parts tunes A4 to 443 Hz
  * Even-numbered Vl, Vla and Vc parts tunes A4 to 437 Hz
  * Double bass tune A4 to 440 Hz (A1 to 55 Hz)

The other strings should be tuned in relation to the A-string as usual.

The tuning should requiere no special seating arrangement. Retuning from standard tuning
to the tuning required by this piece should be as simple as retuning once for each section,
using a tuning machine or similar device.

Intonation
--------

As amost every chord in the piece use open strings or harmonics, harmonic intonation should
not be much of an issue. Melodic intonation must be determined by context:

  * Single melodic lines against open-string chords should follow the perceived fundamental
    of the harmonic background.
  * Polyphonic passages should be intonated to sound well, i.e. slight adjustments may
    be added at the discretions of the ensemble and the conductor.

Doubling
----------

All parts may be doubled. If several parts are doubled but not all, the musicians should
strive for a balance between the two main tuning sections (i.e. avoid doubling just the
upper parts or vice versa). As melodic lines are distributed roughly equally between parts,
this should be reflected in the number of players in each part.

Certain cues are required to be played by a single musician even if the parts are doubled, 
as indicated by *solo* and *tutti*. Preferably, these passages should be distributed evenly 
among the musicians, instead of being played by designated soloists.
