   Defines the root element 'Score' and related information such as the score
   header, basic attributes and meta-information such as credits, layout options
   etc. Each score must have at lest one part. In the trivial case, a simple
   treble clef part is provided. For a more complicated instrumention, see 'PartList'.

   The actual musical data is wrapped up in the 'MusicData' type, which references
   types defined in other modules, notably 'Note', 'Direction' and 'Attributes'.

-- Attribute groups

-- | The MeasureAttributes group is used by the measure element. Measures have a required number
--   attribute (going from partwise to timewise, measures are grouped via the number).
--
--   The implicit attribute is set to 'True' for measures where the measure number should never appear,
--   such as pickup measures and the last half of mid-measure repeats. The value is 'False' if not
--   specified.
--
--   The nonControlling attribute is intended for use in multimetric music.
--   If set to 'True', the left barline in this measure does not coincide with
--   the left barline of measures in other parts. The value is 'False' if not specified. In partwise
--   files, the number attribute should be the same for measures in different parts that share the
--   same left barline.
--
--   While the number attribute is often numeric, it does not have to be. Non-numeric values are
--   typically used together with the implicit or nonControlling attributes being set to 'True'.
--   For a pickup measure, the number attribute is typically set to 0 and the implicit attribute
--   is typically set to 'True'. Further details about measure numbering can be defined using the
--   measureNumbering element. Measure width is specified in tenths. These are the global tenths
--   specified in the scaling element, not local tenths as modified by the staffSize element.

data MeasureAttributes = MeasureAttributes { number         :: String

-- | The DocumentAttributes attribute group is used to specify the attributes for an entire MusicXML
--   document. Currently this is used for the version attribute.
--
--   The version attribute was added in Version 1.1 for the 'PartwiseScore' and 'TimewiseScore'
--   documents. It provides an easier way to get version information than through the MusicXML public
--   ID. The default value is 1.0 to make it possible for programs that handle later versions to
--   distinguish earlier version files reliably. Programs that write MusicXML 1.1 or 2.0 files should
--   set this attribute.

-- | Identification contains basic metadata about the score. It includes the information in MuseData
--   headers that may apply at a score-wide, movement-wide, or part-wide level. The creator, rights,
--   source, and relation elements are based on Dublin Core.
type Identification = TODO


-- | The defaults type specifies score-wide defaults for scaling, layout, and appearance.
type Defaults = TODO

-- | The credit type represents the appearance of the title, composer, arranger, lyricist, copyright,
--   dedication, and other text and graphics that commonly appears on the first page of a score. The
--   creditWords and creditImage elements are similar to the words and image elements for directions.
--   However, since the credit is not part of a measure, the default-x and default-y attributes adjust
--   the origin relative to the bottom left-hand corner of the first page. The enclosure for
--   credit-words is none by default.
--   
--   By default, a series of credit-words elements within a single credit element follow one another in
--   sequence visually. Non-positional formatting attributes are carried over from the previous element
--   by default.
--   
--   The page attribute for the credit element, new in Version 2.0, specifies the page number where the
--   credit should appear. This is an integer value that starts with 1 for the first page. Its value is
--   1 by default. Since credits occur before the music, these page numbers do not refer to the page
--   numbering specified by the print element's pageNumber attribute.

type Credit = TODO


-- ------------------------------------------------------------

-- | The MidiDevice type corresponds to the DeviceName meta event in Standard MIDI Files. The
--   optional port attribute is a number from 1 to 16 that can be used with the unofficial MIDI port
--   (or cable) meta event.
type MidiDevice = TODO

-- | The MidiInstrument type defines MIDI 1.0 instrument playback. The MidiInstrument element can
--   be a part of either the 'ScoreInstrument' element at the start of a part, or the sound element
--   within a part. The id attribute refers to the ScoreInstrument affected by the change.
type MidiInstrument = TODO

-- | The ScoreInstrument type represents a single instrument within a score-part. As with the
--   'ScorePart' type, each ScoreInstrument has a required ID attribute, a name, and an optional
--   abbreviation.
--
--   A ScoreInstrument type is also required if the score specifies MIDI 1.0 channels, banks, or
--   programs. An initial MidiInstrument assignment can also be made here. MusicXML software should be
--   able to automatically assign reasonable channels and instruments without these elements in simple
--   cases, such as where part names match General MIDI instrument names.

type ScoreInstrument = TODO

-- | The PartName type describes the name or abbreviation of a 'ScorePart' element. Formatting
--   attributes for the PartName element are deprecated in Version 2.0 in favor of the new
--   'PartNameDisplay' and 'PartAbbreviationDisplay' elements.
type PartName = TODO

-- | Each MusicXML part corresponds to a track in a Standard MIDI Format 1 file. The 'ScoreInstrument'
--   elements are used when there are multiple instruments per track. The midi-device element is used to
--   make a MIDI device or port assignment for the given track. Initial 'MidiInstrument' assignments may
--   be made here as well.

-- | The PartGroup element indicates groupings of parts in the score, usually indicated by braces and
--   brackets. Braces that are used for multi-staff parts should be defined in the attributes element
--   for that part. The 'PartGroup' start element appears before the first 'ScorePart' in the group. The
--   PartGroup stop element appears after the last score-part in the group. The number attribute is used
--   to distinguish overlapping and nested part-groups, not the sequence of groups. As with parts,
--   groups can have a name and abbreviation. Values for the child elements are ignored at the stop of a
--   group. A PartGroup element is not needed for a single multi-staff part. By default, multi-staff
--   parts include a brace symbol and (if appropriate given the bar-style) common barlines. The symbol
--   formatting for a multi-staff part can be more fully specified using the 'PartSymbol' element.
