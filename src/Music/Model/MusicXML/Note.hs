-- alteration, and the octave.
data Pitch = Pitch Step (Maybe Semitones) Octave

-- | The display-step-octave type contains the sequence of elements used by both the rest and
-- unpitched elements. This group is used to place rests and unpitched elements on the staff
-- without implying that these elements have pitch. Positioning follows the current clef. If
-- percussion clef is used, the display-step and display-octave elements are interpreted as if
-- in treble clef, with a G in octave 4 on line 2. If not present, the note is placed on the
-- middle line of the staff, generally used for one-line staffs.
data DisplayStepOctave = DisplayStepOctave Step Octave


-- | The accidental-value type represents notated accidentals supported by MusicXML. In the

-- | Glissando and slide types both indicate rapidly moving from one pitch to the other so that

--   and portamento elements. A glissando sounds the half notes in between the slide and defaults to a
--   wavy line. The optional text is printed alongside the line.

-- | While using repeater beams was the original method for indicating tremolos, often playback and
--   display are not well-enough integrated in an application to make that feasible. The tremolo
--   ornament can be used to indicate either single-note or double-note tremolos. Single-note tremolos
--   use the single type, while double-note tremolos use the start and stop types. The default is
--   "single" for compatibility with Version 1.1. The text of the element indicates the number of
--   tremolo marks and is an integer from 0 to 6. Note that the number of attached beams is not
--   included in this value, but is represented separately using the beam element.

-- | Stems can be down, up, none, or double. For down and up stems, the position attributes can be

-- | The full-note group is a sequence of the common note elements between cue/grace notes and
--   regular (full) notes: pitch, chord, and rest information, but not duration (cue and grace
--   notes do not have duration encoded). Unpitched elements are used for unpitched percussion,
--   speaking voice, and other musical elements lacking determinate pitch.

--   The isChord attribute indicates that this note is an additional chord tone with the preceding
--   note. The duration of this note can be no longer than the preceding note. In MuseData, a 
--   missing duration indicates the same length as the previous note, but the MusicXML format 
--   requires a duration for chord notes too.

-- TODO note that the Bool indicates whether it is a chord or not

-- | Notes are the most common type of MusicXML data. The MusicXML format keeps the MuseData
--   distinction between elements used for sound information and elements used for notation
--   information (e.g., tie is used for sound, tied for notation). Thus grace notes do not have a
--   duration element. Cue notes have a duration element, as do forward elements, but no tie
--   elements. Having these two types of information available can make interchange considerably
--   easier, as some programs handle one type of information much more readily than the other.
-- 
--   The dynamics and end-dynamics attributes correspond to MIDI 1.0's Note On and Note Off 
--   velocities, respectively. They are expressed in terms of percentages of the default 
--   forte value (90 for MIDI 1.0). The attack and release attributes are used to alter the
--   staring and stopping time of the note from when it would otherwise occur based on the
--   flow of durations - information that is specific to a performance. They are expressed
--   in terms of divisions, either positive or negative. A note that starts a tie should
--   not have a release attribute, and a note that stops a tie should not have an attack
--   attribute. If a note is played only one time through a repeat, the time-only attribute
--   shows which time to play the note. The pizzicato attribute is used when just this note
--   is sounded pizzicato, vs. the pizzicato element which changes overall playback between
--   pizzicato and arco.                                                       
--
--   One dot element is used for each dot of prolongation. The placement element is used to 
--   specify whether the dot should appear above or below the staff line. It is ignored for 
--   notes that appear on a staff space.
