% For string orchestra
% Hans HÃ¶glund 2012

Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This file contains the code for a (yet to be named) piece for string orchestra. It is a
literate source file, meaning it is written both for reading and running as a program.
Throughout, code will appear in a `typewriter font`. The code form a valid Haskell program
that generates the piece.

If you obtain this document in source form, you can convert it to a PDF document using
Pandoc ^[Which can be found at 
[http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc)] 
or compile it to a Haskell program using a Haskell compiler^[Such as GHC, see
[http://www.haskell.org/ghc](http://www.haskell.org/ghc)].

\begin{code}
module Music.Projects.MusicaVitae
where

import Temporal.Media
\end{code}



Instrumentation and tuning
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First we define the instrumentation:

  * Violin I-IV
  * Viola I-II
  * Cello I-II
  * Double Bass

\begin{code}
data Part 
    = Violin Int
    | Viola Int
    | Cello Int
    | DoubleBass
    deriving (Eq, Show)
\end{code}

A basic idea of the piece is to combine (slightly) different tunings of the instruments
using open-string techniques and harmonics. For this purpose, the orchestra is split
into three sections, each using a different tuning:

  * Odd-numbered Vl, Vla and Vc parts tunes A4 to 443 Hz (A3 to 221.5 Hz)
  * Even-numbered Vl, Vla and Vc parts tunes A4 to 437 Hz (A3 to 218.5 Hz)
  * Double bass tunes A1 to 55 Hz

The other strings should be tuned in relation to the A-string as usual.

\begin{code}
data Section 
    = High 
    | Low 
    | Middle 
    deriving (Eq, Show)

partSection (Violin 1)   = High
partSection (Violin 2)   = Low
partSection (Violin 3)   = High
partSection (Violin 4)   = Low
partSection (Viola 1)    = High
partSection (Viola 2)    = Low
partSection (Cello 1)    = High
partSection (Cello 2)    = Low
partSection DoubleBass   = Middle

sectionTuning Low    = 437
sectionTuning Middle = 440
sectionTuning High   = 443

partTuning = sectionTuning . partSection
\end{code}

All parts may be doubled. If several parts are doubled but not all, the musicians should
strive for a balance between the two main tuning sections (i.e. avoid doubling just the
upper parts or vice versa).

Certain cues are required to be played by a single musician even if the parts are
doubled, which will be marked *solo*. These passages should be distributed evenly among
the musicians, instead of being played by designated soloists.



Musical preliminaries
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are going to represent time using the *temporal-media* package^[See
[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/temporal-media](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/temporal-media)].

\begin{code}
type Pitch = Int
data Str   = I | II | III | IV
    deriving (Eq, Show)
    
\end{code}


Playing techniques
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The piece makes use of different playing techniques in both hands. As the intonation
will be different between open and stopped strings, we also define a function mapping
each left-hand technique to a stopping.

\begin{code}                                                            
data Stopping 
    = Open
    | QuarterStopped
    | Stopped    
    
data LeftHand p
    = OpenString p Str
    | NaturalHarmonic p Str
    | NaturalHarmonicTrem p p Str
    | NaturalHarmonicGliss p p Str

    | QuarterStoppedString Str

    | StoppedString p Str
    | StoppedStringTrem p p Str
    | StoppedStringGliss p p Str
    deriving (Eq, Show)

techniqueStopping ( OpenString           _ _   ) = Open
techniqueStopping ( NaturalHarmonic      _ _   ) = Open
techniqueStopping ( NaturalHarmonicTrem  _ _ _ ) = Open
techniqueStopping ( NaturalHarmonicGliss _ _ _ ) = Open
techniqueStopping ( QuarterStoppedString _     ) = QuarterStopped
techniqueStopping ( StoppedString        _ _   ) = Stopped
techniqueStopping ( StoppedStringTrem    _ _ _ ) = Stopped
techniqueStopping ( StoppedStringGliss   _ _ _ ) = Stopped
     
data RightHand a
    = Pizz a
    | Note a
    | Phrase [a]
    | Jete [a]
    deriving (Eq, Show)

\end{code}



Intonation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many playing techiniques in the score calls for open strings. In this case intonation is
determined solely by the tuning.

In some cases, open-string techniques are used with an above first-position stop. This
should make the open string pitch rise about a quarter-tone step (or at least less than
a half-tone step).

Where stopped strings are used, intonation is determined by context:

 * In solo passages, intonation is individual. No attempt should be made to synchronize
   intontation (on long notes et al) for overlapping solo cues.

 * In unison passages, intonation should be synchronized.

\begin{code}
data IntonationType
    = Tuning
    | Raised
    | Solo
    | Choral
\end{code}  



Other preliminaries
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{code}
data Cue = Cue Part (RightHand (LeftHand Pitch))




data Phrasing = Phrasing { attackVel  :: Double 
                         , sustainVel :: [Double]
                         , releaseVel :: Double
                         , staccatto  :: Double }
    
\end{code}
